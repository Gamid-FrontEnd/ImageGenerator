        AI image generation is like magic for pictures! You give it a
        description with words, and it creates a whole new image based on what
        you said. It uses special computer brains called neural networks that
        have been trained on tons of image and text examples. These brains get
        really good at understanding how words connect to visuals, letting them
        build images from your descriptions.
